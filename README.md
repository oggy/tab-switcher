Visual design is inspired by [Witch](http://manytricks.com/witch), a slick Mac
OS window switcher.

## Default Keys

* `alt-[` previous tab
* `alt-]` next tab

## Using it with Ctrl-Tab
To replace the standard behavior in Atom, edit your keymap.cson (Atom -> Open Your Keymap) and add:
```
'atom-workspace':
  'ctrl-tab': 'tab-switcher:next'
  'ctrl-shift-tab': 'tab-switcher:previous'
```
